A reddit style message board built with React and Redux for the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The frontend was built by myself and interacts with a backend server provided by Udacity.

Since finishing the course I refactored the application, improved the styling with Milligram and added Formik to better handle the forms.
