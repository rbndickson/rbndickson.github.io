Love learning, making and travelling.

Studied Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Javascript and associated technologies with Tealeaf Academy, which became <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launchschool</a>.

Looking for an opportunity to contribute to a company making a difference, and to continue learning.

Formerly taught English in elementary schools, junior high schools, and high schools in Tokyo.
